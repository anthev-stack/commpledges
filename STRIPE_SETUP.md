## 🪝 Step 4: Set Up Webhooks (After Deployment)

Webhooks notify your app when payments succeed/fail.

### For Local Development:

1. Install Stripe CLI: [stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)
2. Run:
   ```bash
   stripe login
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```
3. Copy the webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_`)
4. Add to `.env`:
   ```env
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret
   ```

### For Production (Vercel):

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com) → **Developers** → **Webhooks**
2. Click **+ Add endpoint**
3. Enter your endpoint URL:
   ```
   https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```
4. Select events to listen for:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `account.updated`
   - `account.external_account.created`
5. Click **Add endpoint**
6. Copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)
7. Add to Vercel environment variables:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret
   ```

---

## 🌐 Step 5: Add to Vercel

After deployment, add these to Vercel environment variables:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add:
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_live_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_live_key
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret
   ```
